SDUMP
=====

SDUMP is an MSDOS utility that can take any file and dump it's contents over a serial port.

Insstallation:

1. Download the latest release from Github and unzip it to any direectory you like. I recommend `C:\SDUMP`.

2. Edit `SDUMP.INI` with the settings for your serial connection.

3. Run `SDUMP.EXE <filename>` to pipe that file over the serial port you configured.

This tool was built and compiled using Borland C++ 3.1 for MSDOS. Feel free to submit any PRs you like, but please make sure it's compatible with that compiler.
